# 📝 Handwritten Answer Evaluation App using OCR + XLNet

An end-to-end machine learning application that extracts handwritten answers from images and evaluates them using a custom XLNet model trained on semantic similarity.

## 📌 Project Overview

This app takes images of handwritten answers and performs:
1. **OCR** to extract text from question, student answer, and reference answer.
2. **Similarity scoring** using a custom-trained XLNet model.
3. **Bonus logic** to adjust the final score based on thresholds.
4. **User interface** to upload images and view the evaluated score.

## 🧠 Core Technologies

- **FastAPI**: Web framework
- **EasyOCR**: For extracting handwritten text
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: XLNet model
- **Custom Training**: Trained on Q-A-R triplets
- **Docker**: For containerized deployment
- **Hugging Face Spaces**: Live hosted app

## ✍️ Sample Use Case

- Upload 3 images:
  - Question image
  - Student handwritten answer
  - Reference answer
- App will:
  - Extract text
  - Score similarity using model
  - Apply bonus logic
  - Display final score and extracted text
